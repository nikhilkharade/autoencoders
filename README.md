# autoencoders
Tested my first autoencoders architecture using Keras. The dataset used is the LFW dataset. We need three files to run this project. They are:

http://vis-www.cs.umass.edu/lfw/lfw-deepfunneled.tgz
http://vis-www.cs.umass.edu/lfw/lfw.tgz

Once downloaded rest of instructions are given in the notebook.
